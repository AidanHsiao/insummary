	<div class="title">My Web Design Experience</div>
<br>	(I'll use JS instead of making subpages) Coming into this class I expected to both learn and have fun, and that's what I got. Of course, another primary reason was that VAPA credit was required, and I enjoy Web Design compared to everything else. I really appreciated the amount of freedom we were given (may have abused it a bit), and I liked how each site was supposed to be about us. My one problem was that the assignments felt relatively repetitive, as if we were doing to same thing over and over, just changing text. I've also had some amount of web design experience in the past, and my dad is a software designer, so it was the natural choice.
	<br><br><button id="first" onclick="extendfirst()">Skills before the class<div id="firstsymbol">+</div></button><div class="content" id="firstcontent">I had some small amount of web design experience before this; I first (regrettably) used weebly back in 6th-7th grade, and took interst in HTML at that time. I tried to make a half-decent website after that, which was obviously doomed to fail from the start. I then took a digital prototyping class (Web Design and Graphic Design) at d.tech during the second semester of 9th grade, and that's where I really started to hone in on my HTML/CSS skills.</div><br>
	<button id="second" onclick="extendsecond()">Skills after the class<div id="secondsymbol">+</div></button><div class="content" id="secondcontent">My skills in HTML/CSS have significantly improved, and I have developed skills in JavaScript, which allow me to make these really cool sliding thingies. I also now have experience leading (more like carrying) teams when it comes to this stuff. I think the biggest improvement I've made is learning to use GitHub and all of its features, as it is extremely helpful.</div><br>
	So yeah that's that or something
